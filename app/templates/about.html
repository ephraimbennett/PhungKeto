            <h2>Why Minh Keto Was Born</h2>
            <p>
                When I heard rates of <strong>diabetes among the Vietnamese-American community were skyrocketing</strong>, 
                I knew it was due to the high-carb diet many of us participate in.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I set out to make a difference: low carb, keto friendly cuisine and desserts that we all love to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
                At <em>Minh Keto</em>, we bring authentic flavors to your plate,
                <strong>without the sugar spikes or guilt</strong>. 
                We believe healthy food shouldnâ€™t mean losing the tastes that make us who we are.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
